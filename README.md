#### Description:
> In this game you are a hero who is responsible for extermination of bat. You will be provided with random number to hunt for. If the bat gets red and too big, you lose. You win when you have reached the goal.

The project was completed in the following steps:
* I learned all that I needed to know about ***pygame*** Library
* Then I started to create game
    * Firstly created the gun for shooting
        * for the gun to have shooting animation, I made sure that the gif that I had was broken to individual png images which was loaded into the file with help of another library called ***os***
        * created bullets and bullet counts
        * stored the killed bat in the class instead of object for more assecibility and many more....

        <br>
    * next I created the bat to shoot
        * created the bat animation same as gun
        * made random spawns
        * created effect for bat to big

    * made background handling class
        * this class contained intro and outro images
        * it also had texts so as to give the game a small story

In this was with help of simple library and knowledge of python, I was finishing the game.
